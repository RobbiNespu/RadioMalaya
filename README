Hi, i made a bash script by using mplayer and dialog to produce TUI (text user interface) streaming radio channel in Malaysia. I called it as "Radio Malaya". The idea for this tool comes when i was bored and miss so much of my hometown radio (Terengganu FM). So here we are.. Radio Malaya :)
This tool allow you to listen several radio cast that i found on internet, which is :
1. Terengganu FM
2. Muzik FM
3. IKIM FM
4. Nasyid FM
5. Express Tamil Online
6. Fuh FM
7. Cyberfly FM
8. Karya FM
9. Klasik Nasional
10. Hot FM
11. Gomo FM

Thus script are available at my github account ;)

Here a screencast of Radio Malaya on Vimeo : https://vimeo.com/72316897
