*About
======
Hi, i made a bash script by using mplayer and dialog to produce TUI (text user interface) streaming radio channel in Malaysia. I called it as "Radio Malaya". The idea for this tool comes when i was bored and miss so much of my hometown radio (Terengganu FM). So here we are.. Radio Malaya :)
This tool allow you to listen several radio cast that i found on internet, which is :

- UTHM radio
- ~~Terengganu FM~~ No online streaming source anymore even on they official website.. SUCK
- ~~Muzik FM~~ Rebranded to Nasional FM (The slot also changed a lot, no more FUN!)
- IKIM FM
- Nasyid FM
- Express Tamil Online
- Fuh FM
- Cyberfly FM
- Karya FM
- Klasik Nasional
- Hot FM
- Gomo FM
- Rileks Community Online Radio 
- ~~Dungun FM~~ RIP
- Lambat tinggal FM
- Bapakku FM
- KampungChat FM

Thus script are available at my github account ;)
